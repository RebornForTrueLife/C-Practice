# Total parallel resistor

***Calculate total resistor of any number of parallel resistor***

*Preliminary Specification*

## Purpose
> The program is used to calculate the total resistor of 
given number of parallel resistor

## Desciption
- `Input`: Take a number of parallel resistors, and series of float resistor values respectively
- `Output`: a float of total resistor
```
	> The total resistor of [n] parallel resistor is calcuated by the formula: 
							1/R = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + ... + 1/Rn
		Where R is total resistor and R[i] is value of 1 resistor in parallel 
```
## Example
```
	> $ The program is used to calculate total resistor of the given number of parallel resistors
	> $ Please enter the number of resistors: 2
	> $ Please enter the series of resistor values: 400 200
	> $ Total resistor = 133.3 Î©
